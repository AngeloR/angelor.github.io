      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a collection of blogs that I enjoy and try and keep up with. They aren&amp;rsquo;t listed in any particular order. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking to re-live the nostalgia of early webrings in the pre web2.0 era. Infact, at some point I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to move this blog off GitHub pages so that I can start experimenting with some of the IndieWeb functionality&amp;hellip;&#xA;Drew Devaults Blog - https://drewdevault.com Drew’s blog has been something I’ve long followed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Angelo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in Software Development for the last 20 years or so, doing a bit of everything. I started my journey as a &amp;ldquo;Full Stack&amp;rdquo; developer/designer back when 2Advanced Studios launched v3 and over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve moved further and further &amp;ldquo;backward&amp;rdquo; in the stack. Since about 2012 my technical focus has been around Backend/DevOps/SRE work and more broadly around &amp;ldquo;Leveling Up Engineering&amp;rdquo;. I have a history of joining teams that are ready to take the next step from &amp;ldquo;We have this MVP&amp;rdquo; and helping them get to &amp;ldquo;We are a company&amp;rdquo;.</description>
