<h2>About</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angelo. I&rsquo;ve been working in Software Development for the last 20 years or so, doing a bit of everything. I started my journey as a &ldquo;Full Stack&rdquo; developer/designer back when <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/2advanced-studios-v3-2001">2Advanced Studios launched v3</a> and over the years I&rsquo;ve moved further and further &ldquo;backward&rdquo; in the stack. Since about 2012 my technical focus has been around Backend/DevOps/SRE work and more broadly around &ldquo;Leveling Up Engineering&rdquo;. I have a history of joining teams that are ready to take the next step from &ldquo;We have this MVP&rdquo; and helping them get to &ldquo;We are a company&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve gotten to do a bit of everything from Founding  my own Startup in the Security Space, Consulting (Both technical and Engineering Management), Leading teams as a People Manager, and contributing as a Principal Engineer. My own career seems to have a focus on Ed Tech + Security, with a bit of dabbling in Crypto Currency.</p>
<p>This blog is a way for me to document all of the things I&rsquo;ve learned and am still learning about everything I run across. The updates happen sporadically (as life does) and I hope that you&rsquo;ll be able to find something interesting here.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop me an email and we can figure it out.</p>
