This page will serve as the current state of Rising Legends [1], a Persistent Browser-Based Game that I'm working on.

### Skills

All users get the "core" skills: `bladed`, `blunt`, `one handed mastery`, `two handed mastery`, `destruction magic`, `restoration magic`, `light armour mastery`, `heavy armour mastery`. These are all passive and improve based on use.


### Professions

### Wanderer

The primary profession. All players start out as a wanderer. Wanderers gain stat point increases every other level.&nbsp;


### Warrior

+2 STR on even levels, +1 STR, +1 CON on odd

### Rogue

+2 DEX on even levels, +1 DEX, +1 INT on odd

### Mage

+2 INT on even levels, +1 INT, +1 CON on odd

### News

2023-05-07

Started the rework on inventory to support updating skills dynamically. All skills are "affected by" a skill. For example, a Short Sword is affected by your One Handed Mastery skill and your Bladed Mastery skill.

### 2023-05-06

Finally set up a page where I can track the current status of the game (known bugs, changelog, etc.)
