Trying out Helix [1] and just the ease of getting up and running with all the features that I want out of the box was incredible? Like that alone should be enough for new devs to get started. Vim/NeoVim is great if you're already in that world and have years of configs/settings that you're used to. But if you're just starting out with modal editors, you can't compete with everything just working out of the box?

I literally have a git repo where I track my vim config and all the plugins that I use so that I don't need to remember that. Being able to skip out on all of that is a wonderful idea/change.
