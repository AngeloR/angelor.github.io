I've been noodling around in the fediverse for a long time now, entranced by some of the ideas Diaspora had when it first launched.. and mostly just continually disappointed by the various communities that tend to spring up around it. Hoping this foray into the activity-pub based world (kbin, lemmy, pleroma) will be different. But already the main lemmy instance is proving to be a bad one specifically because of the devs. Why can't we just have nice things?

Created the first "Garden" post about my Outliner [1] project which will serve as a long running (forever updating) "home page" for the project.
