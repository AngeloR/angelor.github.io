In a strange twist, it appears that I may be more of a morning person than I though. The last few days I've been going to bed by 9:30 (kids...) and then waking up at 4am and starting my day. It's been a strange experience. By about 7am I've managed to get a bunch of work done and had time to walk the dog before the 30 degree weather kicks in and melts her.

Learned about the `hugo -w` flag which allows hugo to constantly watch/build my posts. So the process from outline -&gt; blog is a bit more streamlined.&nbsp;
