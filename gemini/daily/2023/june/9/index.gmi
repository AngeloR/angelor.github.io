Rising Legends [1] is finally getting to the point where the core game loop is in. It's exciting to be back in this space after so many years. Every couple years I build the mechanics/system for some PBBG - often to test out some new architecture/design patterns. This time I really focused on getting something playable rather than the code behind it. The next step is to start getting some 3rd party testers and early alpha feedback!
