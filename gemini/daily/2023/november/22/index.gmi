Lunar Vim [1] has become my new editor configuration. The easy of setup + inter-plugin configuration trumphs the requirement for me to craft my own personal installation. Out of the plugins that I use, everything works well enough. It's been enough that my configuration has become quite minimal.

**.config/lvim/config.lua**

</script>

To be honest, there's actually very little in here that is required apart from the relative line numbering. The same configuration works across platforms (linux, windows with wsl, mac) and honestly I've run into no real issues with it. There are some minor peculiarities that I've had to re-learn (mostly just which search shortcut based on the scenario). The web-based docs are adequate.. but honestly I think the in-app configuration stuff is a lot clearer to navigate.
