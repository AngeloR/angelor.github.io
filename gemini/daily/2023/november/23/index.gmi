Lunar Vim [1] has become my new editor configuration. The easy of setup + inter-plugin configuration trumphs the requirement for me to craft my own personal installation. Out of the plugins that I use, everything works well enough. It's been enough that my configuration has become quite minimal.

**.config/lvim/config.lua**

To be honest, there's actually very little in here that is required apart from the relative line numbering.
