I've been running https://river.xangelo.ca [1] for a number of years now - going back to tweak things ever-so-slightly. This is the first time I've been happy about the whole system. This whole "build it for yourself" phase seems to be working...

The river is just a few websites that I like to follow, but mostly sporadically. I'll hop on and check things out when I can because I find the content to be pretty interesting. It reads some RSS feeds, and constantly updates the main page with any new posts that I haven't seen yet.
