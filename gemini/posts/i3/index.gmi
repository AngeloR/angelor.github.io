I've recently made the switch from the stock Ubuntu setup over to i3wm. I've 
used xmonad for many years before this, but always found it a bit harder than I 
would have liked to customize it.

Most of what i3 does out of the box works perfectly for me. The only thing I 
didn't like was the fact that navigation was shifted from `hjkl` to `jkl;`. I'm 
also not a big fan of dmenu. Honestly I'm not totally sure why, but I've always 
struggled getting it to do what I wanted.

With i3 I made a few small config changes, and swapped out the launcher and so 
far things have been quite excellent. I'm just posting this here so that I 
don't forget my configs.

## My Config
As a vim user, I'm much more comfortable with the default vim bindings, than the "1 ket to the right" bindings that i3 tends to use.
