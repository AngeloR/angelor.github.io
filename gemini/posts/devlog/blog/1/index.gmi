I've started working on a custom theme for Hugo that I use on my blog. The goal here is to be as simple as possible and takes its inspiration from the IETF .txt file where possible. 

The theme itself contains a light/dark mode as well as a small variation of the main theme for mobile. I actually had some help from a good friend who helped me adjust the colors for both dark and light modes to make them a bit more legible. 

The two complicated components and 1 simple component are outlined below.

## Features

### Numbered Headers

I wanted to ensure that each heading would have a number associated with it that matched the number that it was automatically assigned by Hugo during the Table of Contents generation. I didn't want to have to update numbers as I added/remove header tags and I didn't want to utilize any JavaScript on the site, so I was left with CSS only. 

I ended up utilizing counters to achieve this.



```css
body {counter-reset: h2;}
h2 {counter-reset: h3;} 
h3 {counter-reset: h4;}
h4 {counter-reset: h5;}
h5 {counter-reset: h6;}

h2:before {counter-increment: h2; content: counter(h2) ". ";}
h3:before {counter-increment: h3; content: counter(h2) "."counter(h3) ". ";}
h4:before {counter-increment: h4; content: counter(h2) "."counter(h3) "."counter(h4) ". ";}
h5:before {counter-increment: h5; content: counter(h2) "."counter(h3) "."counter(h4) "."counter(h5) ". ";}
h6:before {counter-increment: h6; content: counter(h2) "."counter(h3) "."counter(h4) "."counter(h5) "."counter(h6) ". "; }
h2.nocount:before,h3.nocount:before,h4.nocount:before,h5.nocount:before,h6.nocount:before {content: ""; counter-increment: none;}
```



I only have a single `<h1>` tag in my document which is for the title of the post, which I don't want numbered. The code above it ensures that every time we run across an `<h2>` tag it will reset the counter for `<h3>` tags to 0, increment the counter for `<h2>` tags, and then display the current value of the counter. 

It repeats this for all header tags appending the counter for each subsequent tag level. 

I've also included provisions for ensuring that you can skip incrementing the counters if you add a `.nocount` class to any header.



### Flexible visual line-up 

This was probably the hardest part.

That dashed line that lets you link a post with the corresponding date. Both elements are positioned at the exterior of their boxes, and the titles have a varying width. 

In order to accomplish this I ended up needing to introduce a 3rd element, the line itself. However, I can't actually use an `<hr />` tag because I want to work towards supporting screen readers.. and those tags get interpreted as dividers between content. 

The article list is an unordered list, so the HTML code looks like this:

```html

	Post Title [2]
	</span>
	YYYY-MM-DD
</li>
```

I set the `<li>` tag to utilize flex `display: flex` and tell it to align the items to the center

I then set the `.divider` to `flex-grow: 1`  and don't set the property on the `<a>` or `.pubdate` elements. This causes the divider to grow to take up the entirety of space within the list element, subtracting the side of the title/date tags. 

```css
.article-list li {
	list-style: none;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
}

.article-list .divider {
	flex-grow: 1;
	border-bottom: 1px dashed black;
	margin: 0.3rem;
}
```

### Dark/Light mode
One of the things that I ended up implementing, that I'm not 100% sold on is the auto dark/light mode. Utilizing CSS we can adjust things to account for if the user is utilizing a light or dark mode on their browser:
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	/* your stuff goes here */
}
```
It's a very simple technique and given the minimalist nature of this site it works rather perfectly. 

Where I'm not 100% happy is on color choices. Where possible I attmpted to tweak things so that they would look the same in light or dark mode. I tweaked the original colors of links (new/visited) and also settled on a particular code-highlighting style.

Where I'm not 100% happy, is with the default font color. In light mode it's browser defaults, but in dark mode it's a blue/grey and I think it might be a tad too dark. It's something that I'll continue tweaking in small batches until I find something that works well.

I also faded out images just a bit so that they're not so jaring. The idea is if you hover/touch the images they'll fade in to full color, but if you're just scrolling through you won't run into any weirdness.

### Support for Utteranc.es
This is something that I recently stumbled across - the ability to utilize GitHub issues to track comments on a site. I really love the idea - especially since I'm hosting my blog on GitHub Pages. By adding some params to your `config.toml` file you'll be able to turn on support for utterances.

```toml
[params.utterances]
repo = "AngeloR/angelor.github.io"
issue_term="pathname"
label="comment"
theme="preferred-color-scheme"
```

The settings match exactly the configuration options provided by utteranc.es, so you should be able to see the mapping quite easiy. The only thing I changed was making it `issue_term` instead of `issue-term`.

If you don't add this configuration, it'll just hide the comment block and you won't even load the utteranc.es client js.

## Download/Install
If you're interested in this theme, you can grab it here https://github.com/AngeloR/plain-hugo-theme

Up to date installation instructions can be found on the readme, but I've included a snapshot of what they were at this point:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngeloR/plain-hugo-theme /path/to/hugo/themes/plain/

Edit your config.toml to add the following line:
theme = "plain"
```

If you do end up using it and come across any bugs, please let me know over on GitHub!
