## Abstract
Whenever you get into the conversation of NoSQL, and specifically "Document based" systems, you inevitably seem to end up on either DynamoDB or Mongo. The truth is while DynamoDB is a wonderful tool, Mongo should probably be your first stop.

## Mongo vs. DynamoDB
Mongo and DynamoDB are two document storage databases in the NoSQL family. Where mongo took the more traditional "server" route, DynamoDB opted for "serverless". As a result, most of the distinction between the two comes from this divide.
