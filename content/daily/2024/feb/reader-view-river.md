The [river](https://river.xangelo.ca) is nice.. but there are some blogs that I like to actually keep up with. But I do only remember sporadically.

I was a big user of Google Reader.. which was killed quite suddenly. I tried numerous alternatives but I just never found one I liked. Maybe this newest addition to the river can be it.

There's a second [reader view](https://river.xangelo.ca/reader.html) that displays the feeds, and also read/unread counts for all of it.
