Been a few days since an update here - mostly because I've been quite swamped. The *Reddit Fiasco* has been somewhat freeing in that I've just moved on from the platform. I never really contributed much in my 13+ years outside of a few DMs and responding to help. I haven't actually replaced it with anything. I like kbin/lemmy.. but I'm really not looking for the same thing. I think I'm looking for smaller communities... again the IndieWeb beckons.&nbsp;

I've also been spending a lot of time working on my PBBG [Rising Legends](https://www.risinglegends.net). It's still not even ready for an alpha.. but the bones are there. It's actually been great to work on it and it's finally at the point where I can start adding content. I took a bunch of extra time to integrate with [AirTable](https://airtable.com/) which has been lovely (if a bit laggy) to work with. Things are finally at the point where I can focus on content for a week or two and then start getting some more dedicated testers involved.&nbsp;

I've also been playing around with funding models for the game that stays away from MTX. I've never been a fan of MTX and always been a fan of FREE. I'll probably have to do a longer post on the matter as there's quite a lot to unpack I think.
