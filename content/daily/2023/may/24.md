I'm attempting to adopt [Dave Winer's](https://scripting.com) posting setup of daily updates. I realize there's so much that I want to just say over the course of the day. Some of it might morph into full blown posts.. some of it will just disappear. I originally thought I would try and transition some into "tweets" and "toots" or whatever mastodon calls them.. but for now they'll just live here.

I moved to hugo about a year ago, mostly to gain the easy github pages integration... I'm only now beginning to discover some of the neat details that made it so popular.
