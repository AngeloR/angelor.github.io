# Angelo Rodrigues

I'm Angelo. I've been working in Software Development for the last 20 years or so, doing a bit of everything. I started my journey as a "Full Stack" developer/designer back when [2Advanced Studios launched v3](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/2advanced-studios-v3-2001) and over the years I've moved further and further "backward" in the stack. Since about 2012 my technical focus has been around Backend/DevOps/SRE work and more broadly around "Leveling Up Engineering". I have a history of joining teams that are ready to take the next step from "We have this MVP" and helping them get to "We are a company". I've gotten to do a bit of everything from Founding  my own Startup in the Security Space, Consulting (Both technical and Engineering Management), Leading teams as a People Manager, and contributing as a Principal Engineer. My own career seems to have a focus on Ed Tech + Security, with a bit of dabbling in Crypto Currency.

This blog is a way for me to document all of the things I've learned and am still learning about everything I run across. The updates happen sporadically (as life does) and I hope that you'll be able to find something interesting here.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to drop me an email and we can figure it out.
