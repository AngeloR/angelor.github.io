When the Canada Post strike hit the headlines, I found myself scrolling through social media, sipping my morning coffee, and shaking my head at the comments. “Just get rid of Canada Post already,” one user declared, punctuating their argument with a digital shrug: “It’s useless these days.” Another chimed in, “Private companies do it better anyway.”

The sentiment is nothing new. After all, who among us hasn’t cursed a delayed package or felt a pang of annoyance when the mail carrier shows up with another “we missed you” slip? But as I considered the current rhetoric, I couldn’t help but feel we were missing something important—something fundamental, even philosophical.

So, let’s take a step back, not just to think about Canada Post, but to approach it through the lens of an old concept that has surprising relevance today: Chesterton’s Fence.

## What Is Chesterton’s Fence?

G.K. Chesterton, the early 20th-century writer and philosopher, offered a piece of advice that has since been immortalized as a thought experiment. He suggested that if you come across a fence in the middle of a road, your first instinct shouldn’t be to tear it down. Instead, you should pause and ask, “Why was this fence put here in the first place?” Only after you fully understand its purpose should you decide whether it’s still needed.

The idea seems almost too simple, but how often do we skip this crucial step in our decision-making? Modern debates are often framed around what’s “antiquated” or “obsolete,” with little regard for why certain systems exist or what their removal might mean in the long run. And this brings us back to Canada Post.

## Canada Post: A Fence in the Modern Landscape

At first glance, Canada Post does seem like a relic. Letter mail volumes are plummeting, and private delivery giants like UPS, FedEx, and Amazon are dominating the parcel delivery market. It’s easy to argue that we could do away with Canada Post entirely and let private companies take over. After all, isn’t that how progress works? We innovate, we move on, and we leave the old ways behind.

But let’s pause for a moment. What happens when we treat a government service like a corporation? Canada Post isn’t just a company that happens to deliver letters. It’s a public service—a system designed not for profit, but for accessibility, reliability, and equity. That difference matters.

Think about it: rural communities, small towns, and remote regions often rely on Canada Post in ways urban centers don’t. Private delivery companies have little financial incentive to serve these areas affordably, if at all. Without Canada Post, would we see a growing divide between who gets access to reliable mail service and who doesn’t? Are we, in our rush to tear down the fence, ignoring the people it protects?

## Lessons from Other Industries: A Cautionary Tale

If you’re still on the fence (pun intended), let’s look at a few examples of what happens when public systems are dismantled in favor of private solutions.

### 1. Public Transit vs. Ride-Sharing Apps

Remember when ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft burst onto the scene, promising convenience and efficiency? Cities around the world embraced them, often neglecting public transit systems in the process. The result? Public transit ridership declined, leading to budget cuts and reduced service. Meanwhile, ride-share prices—initially low—have steadily climbed, and drivers often earn less than minimum wage when expenses are factored in.

### 2. Healthcare: Privatization Pitfalls

In countries where healthcare systems have been partially privatized, access to essential services often becomes a luxury. Take the United States, where the cost of basic medical care can bankrupt a family. In contrast, Canada’s public healthcare system ensures universal access, even if it isn’t always perfect. The difference? Public systems aim to serve everyone, while private companies aim to serve shareholders.

### 3. The Privatization of Prisons

One of the starkest examples is the privatization of prisons. In many cases, private prison operators cut corners to maximize profits, leading to overcrowding, poor conditions, and a perverse incentive to incarcerate more people. This is a chilling reminder of what can happen when essential services are handed over to entities driven solely by the bottom line.

## The Invisible Costs of Convenience

The argument for privatizing Canada Post often hinges on convenience. “Private companies deliver faster,” critics say. “They’re more efficient.” And sure, that might be true—for now. But at what cost?

When you prioritize speed and convenience above all else, you often end up with systems that are unsustainable, inequitable, or both. Amazon Prime might deliver your package in a day, but the hidden costs—environmental damage, exploitative labor practices, and the erosion of smaller competitors—paint a darker picture.

Canada Post, by contrast, operates on principles that private companies aren’t beholden to. Its mandate includes serving all Canadians, regardless of geography or profitability. It’s a reminder that some fences aren’t just barriers—they’re guardrails, protecting the values we hold as a society.

## The Case for Keeping—and Improving—the Fence

None of this is to say that Canada Post is perfect. Like any institution, it has its flaws. But instead of dismantling the system, why not reimagine it? Could Canada Post expand into areas like banking, as other countries’ postal services have done? Could it play a role in green energy initiatives or community development? The fence, in other words, doesn’t have to stay exactly as it is—it just needs to stay.

Chesterton’s Fence teaches us that the past is worth understanding before we discard it. Canada Post, with all its quirks and inefficiencies, exists for a reason. It’s a reminder that some systems, however antiquated they may seem, are worth preserving—not because they’re perfect, but because they serve a purpose that private solutions often fail to replicate.
