# Angelo Rodrigues

I’m Angelo, a seasoned Software Developer with over 20 years of experience spanning various roles and disciplines. My journey began as a “Full Stack” developer/designer in the early 2000s, inspired by projects like [2Advanced Studios v3](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/2advanced-studios-v3-2001). Over time, I’ve moved progressively deeper into the stack. Since 2012, my technical focus has been on Backend development, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), but my broader passion lies in “Leveling Up Engineering”—helping teams and organizations reach their next stage of growth.

I specialize in joining teams that are ready to evolve from “We have an MVP” to “We are a company.” My experience includes founding a startup in the Security space, consulting on both technical challenges and engineering management, leading teams as a People Manager, and driving initiatives as a Principal Engineer. While my career spans a variety of industries, I’ve gravitated toward EdTech and Security, with a few ventures into Cryptocurrency.

This blog serves as a living archive of the insights, techniques, and lessons I’ve gathered along the way. Updates are sporadic, reflecting the ebb and flow of life, but my goal is to provide something valuable for every reader—whether you’re an engineer, a manager, or just curious about the craft.

If you have questions or want to connect, feel free to email me—let’s figure it out together.
