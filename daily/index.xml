      <description>I have a sneaking suspicion that Azure DevOps is way better than GitHub but no one is willing to admit it.
For whatever reason this year has been really bad on my allergies. I&amp;rsquo;m trying a variety of over-the-counter medications but will likely have to resort to something a bit stronger before the summer is out.
I just realized that all the &amp;ldquo;Daily Updates&amp;rdquo; are already one day out of sync due to the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what day it is.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to adopt Dave Winer&amp;rsquo;s posting setup of daily updates. I realize there&amp;rsquo;s so much that I want to just say over the course of the day. Some of it might morph into full blown posts.. some of it will just disappear. I originally thought I would try and transition some into &amp;ldquo;tweets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;toots&amp;rdquo; or whatever mastodon calls them.. but for now they&amp;rsquo;ll just live here.
I moved to hugo about a year ago, mostly to gain the easy github pages integration&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m only now beginning to discover some of the neat details that made it so popular.</description>
