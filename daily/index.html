<ul id="page-list">

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/june/3/">Saturday, June 3rd, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">In a strange twist, it appears that I may be more of a morning person than I though. The last few days I&rsquo;ve been going to bed by 9:30 (kids&hellip;) and then waking up at 4am and starting my day. It&rsquo;s been a strange experience. By about 7am I&rsquo;ve managed to get a bunch of work done and had time to walk the dog before the 30 degree weather kicks in and melts her.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/june/2/">Friday, June 2nd, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">There was something magical about uploading the wordpress zip file to your shared host and going through install.php</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/may/30/">Tuesday, May 30, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">I feel like I&rsquo;m ALMOST there on the process for deployments. I think right now I need to adjust the build process so that after I write a post in the outliner, it gets pushed up to github automatically (the raw data) which builds and deploys it to github pages. That way the &ldquo;built&rdquo; info isn&rsquo;t in github.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/may/26/">Friday, May 26, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">Everyone wanting their own streaming service is just re-inventing cable and the whole reason that services like Netflix &ldquo;distrupted&rdquo;. Gabe Newell said it best &ldquo;[Piracy] is a service issue&rdquo;. And the service here sucks.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/may/25/">Thursday, May 25, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">I have a sneaking suspicion that Azure DevOps is way better than GitHub but no one is willing to admit it.
For whatever reason this year has been really bad on my allergies. I&rsquo;m trying a variety of over-the-counter medications but will likely have to resort to something a bit stronger before the summer is out.
I just realized that all the &ldquo;Daily Updates&rdquo; are already one day out of sync due to the fact that I don&rsquo;t know what day it is.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../daily/2023/may/24/">Thursday, May 24, 2023</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">I&rsquo;m attempting to adopt Dave Winer&rsquo;s posting setup of daily updates. I realize there&rsquo;s so much that I want to just say over the course of the day. Some of it might morph into full blown posts.. some of it will just disappear. I originally thought I would try and transition some into &ldquo;tweets&rdquo; and &ldquo;toots&rdquo; or whatever mastodon calls them.. but for now they&rsquo;ll just live here.
I moved to hugo about a year ago, mostly to gain the easy github pages integration&hellip; I&rsquo;m only now beginning to discover some of the neat details that made it so popular.</span></li>
