      <description>Now Powered by Outlines One of the things that I do every so often is completely re-write the backend of my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly hit upon a UI that I like, but I&amp;rsquo;ve swapped out the backend over the years between various custom iterations, wordpress, ghost, and now finally Hugo. This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve swapped out how I write my blog posts - but kept everything else the same.
The current system allows me to write markdown in vim.</description>

      <title>DEVLOG: Custom Theme for Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a custom theme for Hugo1 that I use on my blog. The goal here is to be as simple as possible and takes its inspiration from the IETF .txt file2 where possible.
The theme itself contains a light/dark mode as well as a small variation of the main theme for mobile. I actually had some help from a good friend3 who helped me adjust the colors for both dark and light modes to make them a bit more legible.</description>
