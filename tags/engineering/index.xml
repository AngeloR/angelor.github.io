      <description>On-call is one of those things that all developers end up doing at some point. My goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to discuss the merit of on-call, but rather what the point of on-call is and how to go about designing what “on-call” means at your company. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start at the very beginning because chances are you&amp;rsquo;re already doing it wrong. I should also note that I&amp;rsquo;m looking at this specifically from a SaaS point of view.</description>
