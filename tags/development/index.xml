      <description>Code Reviews are a Failure As a new startup with one or two engineers on staff, you&amp;rsquo;re very likely not doing code reviews. Engineers at this stage have a very deep understanding of the code - after all, they&amp;rsquo;ve probably written most of it. When it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new feature, these initial developers know exactly how they&amp;rsquo;re going to implement it given the architecture of their code base. Chances are, they keep their own work in a branch, and open a Pull Request or Merge Request, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t asking someone to take a look at it.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I talked about git workflows and I outlined the two big problems I see with git workflows:
 Pull Requests/Reviews Branching Strategies  I took the easy route at the time and just talked about Pull Requests/Reviews. But I was requested to throw some thoughts out around branching strategies and how they should work.
The reason I think branching strategies are such a complicated topic is because it touches more than just git.</description>

      <title>Git Workflows Suck</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tired of all the git workflows. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of talking about the best way to craft commit messages. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of how people pile on the best way to do PRs. I&amp;rsquo;m sick of people picking apart architectural decisions in a PR. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of opening PRs only to have no one look at them for days while I continue to harass people into reviews. I&amp;rsquo;m over the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen a single person clone a PR locally and actually verify that it does what it says it does.</description>
