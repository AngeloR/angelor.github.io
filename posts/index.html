<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/mongo-ux/">Mongo vs. DynamoDB</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">Abstract Whenever you get into the conversation of NoSQL, and specifically &ldquo;Document based&rdquo; systems, you inevitably seem to end up on either DynamoDB or Mongo. The truth is while DynamoDB is a wonderful tool, Mongo should probably be your first stop.
Mongo vs. DynamoDB Mongo and DynamoDB are two document storage databases in the NoSQL family. Where mongo took the more traditional &ldquo;server&rdquo; route, DynamoDB opted for &ldquo;serverless&rdquo;. As a result, most of the distinction between the two comes from this divide.</span></li>

There are a bunch of services out there like that will host your git repositories for free (I personally recommend sourcehut), but you can get a most of what they offer for free with gitweb.
Why would you want to do this?</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/i3/">My i3wm Setup</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">I&rsquo;ve recently made the switch from the stock Ubuntu setup over to i3wm. I&rsquo;ve used xmonad for many years before this, but always found it a bit harder than I would have liked to customize it.
Most of what i3 does out of the box works perfectly for me. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the fact that navigation was shifted from hjkl to jkl;. I&rsquo;m also not a big fan of dmenu.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/devlog/blog/1/">DEVLOG: Custom Theme for Hugo</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">I&rsquo;ve started working on a custom theme for Hugo1 that I use on my blog. The goal here is to be as simple as possible and takes its inspiration from the IETF .txt file2 where possible.
The theme itself contains a light/dark mode as well as a small variation of the main theme for mobile. I actually had some help from a good friend3 who helped me adjust the colors for both dark and light modes to make them a bit more legible.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/devlog/sketchy-heroes/1/">DEVLOG: Infinite Clicker, with a story</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">Introduction I&rsquo;ve been working on Sketchy Heroes for about 2 years now. Honestly it started as more of a learning</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/hugo-github/">Moving to Hugo and GitHub Pages</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">Goal I&rsquo;ve been running my blog over on Ghost1 for a few years now. I really don&rsquo;t have a lot of issues with it, except for the fact that I have to manage the server itself. I&rsquo;ve been running a small Digital Ocean VPS for a number of years where I host my blog. Ghost itself goes through a lot of updates and keeping the application up to date was starting to become a hassle.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/what-is-lootcap/">Serverless with CloudFlare Workers</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">What is LootCap? Last week we (Adam Cochran and myself) launched LootCap. The goal is to provide tracking on a new class of tokens called Loot. It&rsquo;s been a few years since I used to work at Vault of Satoshi and since that time I fell a bit out of Crypto Currencies. I always felt that most of the buzz around them was focused on the tech or the coin itself.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/the-disk-is-slow/">The Disk Is Slow</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">&ldquo;The disk is slow&rdquo; is one of those things that most programmers take for granted. Yes it is slow given the speed of other components. But rarely have programmers taken the time to dig into WHY the disk is slow and what that actually means. Yet, doing so can lead us down some interesting rabbit holes.
What is slow? For a while now the speed of a hard-drive was measured in RPM or Revolutions Per Minute.</span></li>

<li class="page-list-item"><a href="../posts/what-the-heck-is-a-database-index/">What the heck is a Database Index?</a> &mdash; <span class="page-summary">When you do a standard select * from table_name where columns=some_value from a table.. the database has no idea where IN the table that data exists. In order to figure out which rows in the table it needs to return to you (based on your where clause), it looks through the rows in the table. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t set a limit clause, it has to look through EVERY single entry in the table because it doesn&rsquo;t know where/how-many instances of a particular value it might find.</span></li>
