<p><a href="https://newsriver.xangelo.ca">News River</a> is an auto-updating stream of news that doesn&rsquo;t need to clutter up your RSS feeds. It was based off ideas from <a href="https://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>. There are some sites that you don&rsquo;t necessarily CARE about reading every single update. Sometimes you just want to see the most recent stuff and move on. Sites like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a> and some subreddits (<a href="https://reddit.com/r/devops">/r/devops</a> or <a href="https://reddit.com/r/aws">/r/aws</a>) are things that I&rsquo;m curious about more recent things that get up there, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to read every single item. Normally I&rsquo;m just skimming for interesting titles.</p>
<p>I used to have these things synced up to my RSS reader, but the sheer number of updates to them caused me to go insane. There&rsquo;s no reasonable way to keep up with all of that stuff. So I had to pull them and then just.. remember to go there. Eventually I got tired of that and wrote the first News River system. You provide a list of sources (RSS or RedditJSON) and it will periodically scan them, download the items, save them, and serve them up for you to see in a simple little auto-updating front-end.</p>
<p>It was a pretty handy tool that was written in Node.js and relied on Redis as the backend storage, with everything hosted on Heroku. It was written at a time when I was really digging into various Redis use cases and the free-form nature was a useful thing when trying to figure out the project. However, due to the nature of Redis I had to jump through quite a few loops to &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; queries. It had a strange bucketing system for the keys that allowed me to query all updates in the last 10 minutes by grouping all updates into sets where the key was in 5 minute intervals. It was a crazy system and honestly most of the code was handling the bucketing+tests for it.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite3">Sqlite3</h2>
<p>The latest version of NewsRiver actually rips out Redis and replaces it with Sqlite3. The crazy bucketing system no longer exists since I can just sort by rounded date values. By utilizing sqlite3 instead of Redis I was able to move the entire system over to a small VPS that I ran and eliminate the heroku requirement for running it. The move to sqlite3 was really pushed by the need to simplify the code base.</p>
<p>NewsRiver is not a project I want to keep tinkering with. I&rsquo;d like it to be complete and to be able to use it daily without making a bunch of tweaks. But the date code had become unwieldy and as a result I spent most of time reviewing it to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t breaking it when fixing things. Moving to sqlite3 allowed me to drop that whole system, delete a ton of code, and just move to something that didn&rsquo;t really require a lot of explanation/documentation.</p>
<p>Eventually we can replace the sqlite3 only setup by utilizing something like <code>knex</code> to allow for a swappable data storage layer.</p>
