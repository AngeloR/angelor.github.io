      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running https://river.xangelo.ca for a number of years now - going back to tweak things ever-so-slightly. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy about the whole system. This whole &amp;ldquo;build it for yourself&amp;rdquo; phase seems to be working&amp;hellip;&#xA;The river is just a few websites that I like to follow, but mostly sporadically. I&amp;rsquo;ll hop on and check things out when I can because I find the content to be pretty interesting.</description>

      <description>Lunar Vim has become my new editor configuration. The easy of setup + inter-plugin configuration trumphs the requirement for me to craft my own personal installation. Out of the plugins that I use, everything works well enough. It&amp;rsquo;s been enough that my configuration has become quite minimal.&#xA;.config/lvim/config.lua&#xA;To be honest, there&amp;rsquo;s actually very little in here that is required apart from the relative line numbering. The same configuration works across platforms (linux, windows with wsl, mac) and honestly I&amp;rsquo;ve run into no real issues with it.</description>

      <description>After about a month helix is something I dropped. I work on linux, mac&amp;rsquo;s and Windows envs and if my editor can&amp;rsquo;t do the same I drop it. Unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s a weird bug in helix where some keypresses (like escape to get out edit mode) take a second to register. That seriously messes with my workflow where I mash esc and then quickly jump to another section.. Enough to make using Helix a frustrating experience.</description>

      <description>Trying out Helix and just the ease of getting up and running with all the features that I want out of the box was incredible? Like that alone should be enough for new devs to get started. Vim/NeoVim is great if you&amp;rsquo;re already in that world and have years of configs/settings that you&amp;rsquo;re used to. But if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out with modal editors, you can&amp;rsquo;t compete with everything just working out of the box?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of posts with images.. mostly because I do all my work in markdown and rarely preview as I&amp;rsquo;m going. However this new outliner writing method has me paranoid and constantly previewing the content as I go and it&amp;rsquo;s made me add images for the first time in a long time&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Been a few days since an update here - mostly because I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite swamped. The Reddit Fiasco has been somewhat freeing in that I&amp;rsquo;ve just moved on from the platform. I never really contributed much in my 13+ years outside of a few DMs and responding to help. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually replaced it with anything. I like kbin/lemmy.. but I&amp;rsquo;m really not looking for the same thing. I think I&amp;rsquo;m looking for smaller communities&amp;hellip; again the IndieWeb beckons.</description>
